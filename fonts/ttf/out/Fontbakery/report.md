* [com.google.fonts/check/family/underline_thickness](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/post.html#com.google.fonts/check/family/underline_thickness)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Dave C Lemon (Adobe Type Team) recommends setting the underline thickness to be
consistent across the family.

If thicknesses are not family consistent, words set on the same line which have
different styles look strange.

</pre>

* üî• **FAIL** Thickness of the underline is not the same across this family. In order to fix this, please make sure that the underlineThickness value is the same in the 'post' table of all of this family font files.
Detected underlineThickness values are:
	Eczar-Bold.ttf: 93
	Eczar-ExtraBold.ttf: 100
	Eczar-Medium.ttf: 78

* [com.google.fonts/check/usweightclass](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/usweightclass)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Google Fonts expects variable fonts, static ttfs and static otfs to have
differing OS/2 usWeightClass values.

For Variable Fonts, Thin-Black must be 100-900
For static ttfs, Thin-Black can be 100-900 or 250-900
For static otfs, Thin-Black must be 250-900

If static otfs are set lower than 250, text may appear blurry in legacy Windows
applications.

Glyphsapp users can change the usWeightClass value of an instance by adding a
&#x27;weightClass&#x27; customParameter.

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

Glyph name: uni200C	Contours detected: 1	Expected: 0

<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
